    <div class="container-narrow">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">Country Place has been a part of the Hico community for years. What started as a small mobile home park has grown into a mixed-use residential community offering furnished cabins, RV pads, and mobile home sites — all on one quiet, well-maintained property.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">We have an on-site point of contact who lives right here in the community, so there's always someone nearby when you need help. We take pride in keeping things simple and straightforward — no hidden fees, just honest, affordable housing with personal attention and a hands-on approach.</p>

      <h2>The Hico Lifestyle</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">Hico, Texas is one of those small towns that people stumble into and never want to leave. With a charming downtown, friendly locals, and some of the prettiest countryside in the state, it's an ideal place to slow down and enjoy life.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">The town sits at the northern edge of the Texas Hill Country along the Bosque River. It's big enough to have what you need — groceries, hardware, dining — and small enough that people still wave when they drive by.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">If you work in Stephenville, Glen Rose, Meridian, or anywhere in the Hamilton County area, Country Place puts you in a central location with an easy commute and a peaceful place to come home to.</p>
